Azure / Jupyter Notebooks representing my study with hands on data science &amp; machine learning models

Notebooks

climatechange.ipynb   : Using popular Python libraries — scikit-learn, NumPy, and Seaborn — to analyze climate data collected by NASA.
On-Time Flight Arrivals.ipynb   : Import airline arrival data into a Jupyter notebook and use Pandas to clean it. Then, build a machine learning model with Scikit-Learn and use Matplotlib to visualize output.
kerasnotebook.ipynb   : Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python, that runs on top of other deep learning tools such as TensorFlow. This module uses Keras to build a neural network that scores text, such as user reviews for sentiment.
